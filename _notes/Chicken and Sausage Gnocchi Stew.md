### Ingredients

#### Slurry

- 3 tablespoons all purpose flour, or gluten-free flour mix
- 1/4 cup half and half
- 1 cup cold water, divided

#### Soup

- 7 ounces sweet Italian chicken sausage, removed from casings
- 5 cups chicken broth
- 1 large shallot, diced
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons tomato paste
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast
- 1 parmesan cheese rind
- 1/3 cup sundried tomatoes in oil, drained and chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
- 16 ounce package gnocchi, or gluten-free gnocchi
- 4 cups fresh baby spinach leaves, rough chopped
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated
-  2 tbsp fresh basil , optional for garnish
## Instructions

- Create a slurryÂ by combining 1/2 cup of the cold water, half and half and flour in a small bowl and whisk until well blended. Set aside.    
- Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat and spray with oil then add the sausage. Cook the sausage, breaking up with a wooden spoon as it cooks, until no longer pink and slightly browned.    
- Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft, 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and chicken breast.    
- Pour the remaining 1/2 cup water and chicken broth, parmesan rind, sundried tomatoes, Italian seasoning and bring to a boil. Partially cover and simmer on low until vegetables are soft and the chicken shreds easily, about 25 minutes.    
- Remove the chicken and set aside, shred with 2 forks.    
- Return the chicken to the pot then slowly stir in slurry, stirring well as you add and bring it back to a boil.    
- Add the gnocchi, spinach, parmesan cheese and basil; cook according to package directions for the gnocchi, or until they start to float to the top and soup thickens. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, discard parmesan cheese rind and serve.
