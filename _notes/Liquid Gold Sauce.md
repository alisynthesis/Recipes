A creamy, dreamy, vibrant sauce that looks like liquid gold. Made with simple ingredients like chickpeas, lemon, garlic, and nutritional yeast, it’s perfect for adding to bowl meals, salads, roasted vegetables, and more! Just 10 minutes and 1 blender required!
### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas (rinsed and drained)
- 1 Tbsp [nutritional yeast](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OK0IAOO/?tag=minimalistbaker-20) (if you can’t have, omit)
- 2 small cloves garlic, skin removed
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice (or sub lime)
- 1 Tbsp [tahini](https://www.amazon.com/365-Everyday-Value-Organic-Tahini/dp/B074M9NT8R/?tag=minimalistbaker-20) (or cashew butter)
- 1/4 tsp sea salt, plus more to taste
- 1/4 tsp ground turmeric
- 1/4 tsp [curry powder](https://minimalistbaker.com/diy-curry-powder/) (or store-bought)
- 1/8 tsp ground cumin (for milder sauce, omit the cumin and use only curry powder)
- 1 dash cayenne pepper (_**optional**_ // omit for less heat)
- 2 tsp maple syrup (plus more to taste)
- 1/3 cup water, plus more as needed
## Instructions

- To a [small blender](https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnDNhzUx_C6Gr6Y3cvIlxqMAAAFsz2OxpgEAAAFKAc8SMlw/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TIE0GQ/?creativeASIN=B007TIE0GQ&linkCode=w61&imprToken=cWEktS2DHtWGmh0b0Ce.nQ&slotNum=33&tag=minimalistbaker-20) (or [food processor](https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QoFbLsbkzpybV1uuFyV1DVEAAAFsz2QD2AEAAAFKAcLEpic/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LBZOYAK/?creativeASIN=B00LBZOYAK&linkCode=w61&imprToken=bIgJWsi3ubfzaCAVpAdf7g&slotNum=7&tag=minimalistbaker-20), though it won’t be as creamy), add chickpeas, nutritional yeast, garlic, lemon, tahini, salt, ground turmeric, curry powder, ground cumin, cayenne (optional), maple syrup, and water.
- Blend on high until creamy and smooth. Add more water as needed until a thick, pourable sauce is achieved.
- Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt to taste, curry powder for spice, tahini for creaminess / nuttiness, lemon for acidity, cayenne for heat, or maple syrup for sweetness.
- Use immediately or store covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week. You can also freeze it up to 1 month and thaw before use (do not heat) although best when fresh.
- Perfect for use on just about anything — think roasted sweet potatoes, burrito bowls, salads, and more!

## Notes
- Probably double this. It's good.
