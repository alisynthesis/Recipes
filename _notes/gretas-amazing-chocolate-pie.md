This is a ridiculously easy, unbelievably delicious recipe for chocolate pie.

### Ingredients

*   1 single pie crust (this is an open-faced pie). More on pie crust in a tic.
*   1 stick butter
*   1 cup sugar
*   2 eggs
*   3 Tbsp. evaporated milk
*   2 squares/ ounces baking chocolate (unsweetened)
*   Whipped cream (optional in theory, mandatory in my opinion)
*   If you want:
*   1/8 tsp. ground cardamom
*   1/8 tsp. ground nutmeg
*   1/4 tsp. ground white pepper

### Instructions

1.  Bake the unfilled pie shell for 5-10 minutes at 450 degrees, until it’s starting to firm up a little but isn’t cooked through
2.  Melt butter and chocolate in a saucepan
3.  Add the other ingredients (minus the whipped cream) and mix; you can do this in the saucepan. (I add the eggs last, so the melted butter and chocolate have a chance to cool and the eggs don’t scramble.)
4.  Pour the filling into the pie shell.
5.  Bake for 30-40 minutes at 325 degrees, until the filling is set. (I usually test it at 30 minutes, but it usually still needs another 5-10 minutes. When it’s no longer jiggling in the middle, it’s done.)

### Additional notes

A quick note on the baking chocolate: For the sweet love of Loki and all the gods in Valhalla, use Scharffen Berger’s if you possibly can, or some other seriously good baking chocolate. I made this pie for years using just regular baking chocolate from the supermarket, and it was perfectly yummy… but once I started using Scharffen Berger’s, it amped up from delicious to transcendent. I frankly don’t much care for Scharffen Berger’s eating chocolate, I think the mouth- feel is insufficiently creamy… but for cooking, their baking chocolate is beyond compare.
