### Ingredients

*   7 - 8 ounces extra-firm tofu cut into thin 1-inch segments (see photo)
*   a couple pinches of fine-grain sea salt
*   a couple splashes of olive or peanut oil
*   2 medium cloves garlic, minced
*   1/3 cup pecans, toasted and chopped
*   3 tablespoons fine-grain natural cane sugar or brown sugar
*   1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
*   1/2 lb. brussels sprouts, washed and cut into 1/8-inch wide ribbons

### Instructions

1.  Cook the tofu strips in large hot skillet (or pot) with a bit of salt and a splash of oil. Saute until slightly golden, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and pecans, and cook for another minute. Stir in sugar. Cook for another couple of minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro. Scrape the tofu out onto a plate and set aside while you cook the brussels sprouts.
2.  In the same pan (no need to wash), add a touch more oil, another pinch of salt, and dial the heat up to medium-high. When the pan is nice and hot stir in the shredded brussels sprouts. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes, stirring a couple times (but not too often) until you get some golden bits, and the rest of the sprouts are bright and delicious.
