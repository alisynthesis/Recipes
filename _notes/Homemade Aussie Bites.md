### Ingredients

- 1¾ cups rolled oats 
- ¼ cup dried apricots (prunes, figs or dates can be substituted)
- ¼ cup raisins or cranberries
- ¼ cup coconut sugar (or brown/cane sugar)
- ¼ cup shredded coconut (unsweetened)
- ¼ cup puffed amaranth (or puffed, cooked, or raw quinoa)
- ¼ cup sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds
- ¼ cup flax meal
- 2 tablespoons chia seeds
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ⅓ cup coconut oil (melted)
- ¼ cup maple syrup (honey or agave nectar can be substituted)
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract


### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 24-count mini muffin pan or line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Add 1 cup of the rolled oats to your food processor. Let it run until the oats are turned into a fine flour.

3. To that add the remaining ¾ cup of rolled oats, ¼ cup dried apricots, ¼ cup raisins, ¼ cup coconut sugar, ¼ cup shredded coconut, ¼ cup puffed amaranth, ¼ cup sunflower seeds, ¼ cup flax meal, 2 tablespoon chia seeds, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon baking soda.

4. Close the lid and pulse the food processor repeatedly until the dried fruit is cut up into small bits.

5. To the dry mix add ⅓ cup melted coconut oil, ¼ cup maple syrup, and ½ teaspoon vanilla extract. Pulse again until everything is evenly moistened and combined.

6. Divide the mixture into the prepared mini muffin cavities and press down to compress the Aussie bites. Alternatively, use a small cookie scoop (1 tablespoon size) and form 24 mounds on a lined baking sheet.

7. Bake the Aussie bites for 10-12 minutes until golden. Let them cool in the pan (or on it) before removing and storing.

8. Keep the Aussie bites in an airtight container at room temperature for about 1 week.
