### Ingredients

* 1 medium sweet potato, cut into 1-inch cubes (1 medium sweet potato is ~2/3 lb and yields ~2 cups or 300 g cubed and 1 cup or 200 g mashed)
- 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips, melted (ensure vegan/dairy-free as needed // we like [Enjoy Life](https://www.amazon.com/Enjoy-Life-Chocolate-Morsels-Ounce/dp/B00FE5GFM8/?tag=minimalistbaker-20))
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1/8 tsp sea salt
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

#### FOR SERVING _optional_

- [Coconut whipped cream](https://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream/)
- Fresh berries
- Shaved dark chocolate

### Instructions

1. - Place the peeled, cubed sweet potato into a [steamer basket](https://www.amazon.com/Chef-Craft-Stainless-Steamer-9-5-Inch/dp/B0029728H0/?tag=minimalistbaker.com) over boiling water, cover, and steam until very soft (it should be easy to poke with a fork), about 10-15 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate chips by adding them to a small glass or metal bowl and carefully placing the bowl on top of a saucepan of simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally with a spatula or spoon, until melted and no lumps remain, about 5 minutes. You can also melt them in a heat-proof bowl in the microwave in 20-second increments. Remove from heat.
3. Mash the sweet potato, measure out 1 cup (200 g) of it (adjust amount if altering the default number of servings), and add it to a [high-speed blender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008H4SLV6/?tag=minimalistbaker-20) with the maple syrup, sea salt, and vanilla extract. You can use any extra sweet potato as a [snack](https://minimalistbaker.com/baked-sweet-potatoes-2-ways/) or freeze for adding to [smoothies](https://minimalistbaker.com/immune-booster-orange-smoothie/) or other desserts. Blend on high until smooth and creamy.
4. Next, slowly drizzle in the melted chocolate and blend on high for at least 1 minute, scraping down the sides a few times, until the mixture is completely smooth. It should look like silky melted chocolate.
5. Divide the mixture into 4 small ramekins or glasses (we like shallow, wide dessert glasses like [these](https://rstyle.me/+ijBqbVnj1SOu0dVC4mxNXw)) and gently shake the jars/cups to even out the tops. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before enjoying!
6. Serve chilled on its own or topped with optional [coconut whipped cream](https://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream/), shaved dark chocolate, and/or fresh berries
7. Store any leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days or in the freezer for 1 month (or longer).
