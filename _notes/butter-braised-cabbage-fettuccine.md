### Ingredients

*   1 small head cabbage, cored, quartered, and shaved into 1/4"-wide ribbons
*   2 large onions, sliced
*   1/2 cup olive oil
*   3 large cloves garlic, minced
*   1 1/2 tsp. black pepper
*   1 stick butter
*   3 Tbsp. red wine vinegar
*   1 cup grated Parmesan
*   1 lb. box fettuccine
*   kosher salt, to taste
*   Crumbly cheese, like ricotta salata or queso fresco, for serving (optional)

### Instructions

1.  In a Dutch oven over high heat, saute the onions in the olive oil for 5 minutes until they begin to color, then add the garlic and continue sauteing until golden brown. Stir in the cabbage a handful at a time with a pinch of salt, letting each addition cook for about 30 seconds until wilted before adding the next handful.
2.  Reduce the heat to medium, stir in the pepper, and cook the cabbage uncovered, stirring occasionally, until it begins to color slightlyâ€”about 15-20 minutes. Add the stick of butter, reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue cooking slowly while you make the pasta.
3.  Fill a large pot with about one gallon of water (no need to measure); cover and bring to a boil. Stir in 2 tablespoons of kosher salt, then add the fettuccine and cook until just al dente. Fill a measuring cup with 2 cups of pasta water, then drain the pasta.
4.  Add red wine vinegar, Parmesan cheese, and 3/4 cup pasta water to the Dutch oven, then add the fettuccine and toss. Turn the heat up to medium high and cook for two minutes, adding additional pasta water at your own discretion, and serve immediately with lots of freshly cracked pepper and a bit of crumbled cheese, if desired.

### Additional notes

This basic cabbage recipe is REALLY flexible.
