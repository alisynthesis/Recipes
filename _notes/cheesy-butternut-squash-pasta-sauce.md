Makes 4 cups

Prep 20 minutes

Cook 35 minutes

Total 55 minutes

### Ingredients

*   2 1/2 cups butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
*   1 tablespoon olive oil
*   1 tablespoon butter
*   1/3 cup onion, finely chopped
*   3 cloves garlic, minced
*   1/3 apple, peeled and chopped
*   1 cup chicken broth
*   1/3 cup milk
*   1/3 cup Italian cheese blend (Parmesan, Asiago, and Romano)
*   salt and ground black pepper to taste

### Instructions

1.  Place the squash into a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Simmer the squash until very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain excess water. Cooked squash should equal 2 cups.
2.  Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-low heat, and cook the onion, garlic, and apple, stirring frequently, until softened and brown, about 15 minutes. Add butternut squash and chicken broth, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat just to a simmer, and stir in the milk and cheese blend. Stir until the cheese has melted and the sauce has reached desired thickness, 5 to 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
