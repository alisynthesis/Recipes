These easy chocolate cookies don't require cooking or baking. They are only 2 ingredients and come out very rich and chocolatey.

### Ingredients
*  1 cup (88 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
*   7 tbsp (3.5 oz) maple syrup
 
 ### Instructions
*  Add ingredients to a mixing bowl. Use a spoon to mix until a dough forms and no traces of dry cocoa powder remain. When you first start mixing, it may seem that there is not enough liquid, but it takes time for the maple syrup to get absorbed. After about 30 seconds to 1 minute, you should see the cocoa powder begin to clump up and eventually all of the cocoa powder should be incorporated and a thick dough should form. The dough will be thick and a little stiffer than typical cookie dough. Taste the dough. If you find that it needs a little more sweetness or if you find your dough is too dry, you can add 1 more tbsp of syrup.   
*   Divide dough into 10 dough balls. Roll dough ball between your palms and then press down to form a thick round disk. Repeat with remaining cookies. Cookies can be enjoyed right away. Store uneaten cookies in an airtight container.
