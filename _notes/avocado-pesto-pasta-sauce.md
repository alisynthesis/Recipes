Super rich and silky, this savory avocado sauce is a dream to add to any variety of pasta for an easy meal. Also delicious on salads or veggies!

Total 20 minutes

### Ingredients

*   1 large avocado

*   2 lemons, juiced pinch of zest
*   big handful of greens (basil or other leafy greens like kale, arugula, spinach, parsley)
*   nutritional yeast to taste -- fold into pasta directly (I like to add a lot!)
*   optional: for a hint of sweet, add 2-3 tsp maple syrup to the sauce

### Instructions

1.  Boil water and add any variety of pasta. Cook until tender. Drain pasta, but set aside about a cup of pasta water.
2.  Add all sauce ingredients to a blender and blend on high until silky smooth.
3.  Pour as much sauce as you'd like over top the pasta -- start with a small amount and add more until it is creamy to your preferences. Toss well. Make sure the pasta is still very warm/hot whe you add the sauce so that the pasta warms the sauce. Note: you could lightly simmer the sauce to warm before adding the the pasta, but I personally prefer this sauce raw since it contains raw avocado.
4.  Serve! Store leftovers in the fridge -- delicious war or chilled.
