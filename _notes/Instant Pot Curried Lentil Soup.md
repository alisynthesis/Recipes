## Instructions

### INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS

-   Turn on the sauté function on your [Instant Pot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RCNHTLS/?tag=minimalistbaker-20) (to the default "Normal" — not high or low). Once hot, add coconut oil, onion, carrots, garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper and sauté for 3-5 minutes, until softened. Turn off the sauté function by pressing "Cancel."
    
-   Add the curry powder, potatoes, lentils, and vegetable broth, and stir to combine. Lock the lid in place, turn the valve to “Sealing,” and select High Pressure for 10 minutes. Once the timer goes off, let the steam release naturally for 15 minutes, then manually release any remaining pressure. When the valve drops, carefully remove the lid.
    
-   Add kale or spinach and coconut milk and cook for 2-3 minutes to wilt. Taste and adjust as needed, adding coconut sugar or more coconut milk to balance the heat, curry powder for intense curry flavor, or more salt to taste.
    
-   Serve as is, or garnish with fresh cilantro and lemon juice (optional). It’s delicious paired with [naan](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-vegan-naan/) (or [gluten-free naan](https://minimalistbaker.com/fluffy-gluten-free-naan-yeast-free-20-minutes/)), toasted bread, or [garlic bread](https://minimalistbaker.com/the-best-vegan-garlic-bread/).
    
-   Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for 4-5 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. Reheat in a saucepan or the microwave until warmed throughout.
