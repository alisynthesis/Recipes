### Ingredients

*   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
*   1 onion, grated
*   2 cloves garlic, chopped
*   1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut in half
*   3 teaspoons ground turmeric
*   1 teaspoon chili powder
*   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
*   1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes
*   2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)

### Instructions

1.  Heat the oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic, and cook for about 2 minutes. Add the chicken, and season with turmeric, chili powder and salt. Fry gently, scraping the bottom of the pan frequently and turning the chicken.
