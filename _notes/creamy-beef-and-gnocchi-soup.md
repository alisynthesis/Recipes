### Ingredients

*   1 pound grass-fed beef
*   1 tsp garlic powder
*   1 tsp onion powder
*   1 Tbs. Italian seasoning
*   1 (28 oz) jar favorite marinara
*   4 cups chicken stock
*   1/2 cup heavy cream
*   1 pound store-bought gnocchi
*   1 (5 oz) tub baby spinach
*   1 lemon
*   Freshly grated parmesan cheese
*   Parsley, for garnish
*   Salt and pepper

### Instructions

1.  In a deep pot, brown the beef over medium heat, until no longer pink. If you need to drain the fat, shame on you! Just kidding, totally drain that. Then add the garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and a big pinch of salt. And maybe a splash of water to add moisture back to the beef, if needed. Brown it a minute further, letting the seasonings soak in.
2.  Then add the marinara, stock, gnocchi and spinach. Continue to simmer on a medium heat until the spinach starts to wilt. Add the cream and stir it all together, letting the gnocchi soften and the spinach finish wilting.
3.  Add a big pinch of salt to taste. Now either add 2 Tbs. fresh lemon juice to the pot, or serve with lemon wedges for the individual squirter. Because individual squirters are a real thing.
4.  Garnish with fresh parmesan, parsley and maybe a grind or two of black pepper!
5.  Serves 4-6.
> To bulk it up, add another pound of gnocchi. That would be a good life move.
