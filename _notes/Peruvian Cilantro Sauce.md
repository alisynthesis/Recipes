### Ingredients

- 2 whole jalapeños (roughly chopped)
- 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1 lime (juiced)
- 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions

1.  Combine jalapeños, cilantro, garlic, mayonnaise, lime juice, and vinegar in a blender or food processor. Turn on high speed, pausing to scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, until smooth. With the blender running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use.

## Notes
- didn't use jalapenos the first time, but a bit of cayenne. It was good.
- I think it would be good with yogurt too. Maybe even better.
