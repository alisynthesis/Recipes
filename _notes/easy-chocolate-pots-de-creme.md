Makes 4 servings

Prep 5 minutes

Cook 5 minutes

Total 10 minutes

### Ingredients

*   6 ounces high quality dark chocolate
*   2 cups heavy cream (dairy free: use coconut milk)
*   3 egg yolks
*   3 tablespoons white granulated sugar (see Note)
*   â…› teaspoon salt

### Instructions

1.  Chop up the chocolate and place it in a blender. Set aside.
2.  Place the cream, egg yolks, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisking to combine the ingredients. Continue to whisk continually until the mixture just starts to bubble and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
3.  Pour the hot mixture into the blender with the chocolate and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into individual ramekins and refrigerate for 6-8 hours or until set (I often chill them overnight).
4.  For a softer consistency, let the pots de creme sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes before serving.
5.  Serve with a dollop of whipped cream on top with a sprinkle of grated chocolate or chocolate curls.
