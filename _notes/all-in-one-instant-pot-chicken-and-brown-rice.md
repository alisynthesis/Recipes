Makes 8 servings

### Ingredients

*   1 medium – onion
*   3 clove – garlic
*   2 cup – carrots, baby
*   2 cup – mushrooms, brown, Italian, or Crimini
*   2 cup – brown rice, raw
*   1 tablespoon – olive oil
*   2 1/4 cup – chicken broth, low-sodium
*   2 pound – chicken thigh, boneless, skinless
*   1/8 teaspoon – salt
*   1/8 teaspoon – black pepper, ground
*   1 can (10.75 oz) – soup, cream of chicken, canned, condensed
*   2 tablespoon – Worcestershire sauce
*   1 tablespoon – thyme, fresh

### Instructions

1.  Push "saute" button on Instant Pot. While it heats, dice onion, mince garlic, and chop veggies. Rinse and drain rice.
2.  When pot says "HOT," add oil to pot and saute onions for 3 minutes. Then press "cancel" to turn the saute setting off.
3.  Mix veggies, garlic, rice, and broth into the pot. Place chicken on top, salt and pepper, then cover with cream of chicken soup (homemade is preferable) and Worchestershire sauce. Place 8-10 small sprigs of thyme on top. NOTE: chicken breasts also work well, just make sure to cut them in half so they're not too thick.
4.  Seal the Instant Pot, close the vent, and press "manual." Use the "pressure" button to toggle to high pressure, then set the time for 31 minutes. After 10 seconds the pot should register that it has begun the pressurizing process. UPDATE: 26 minutes works better to keep veggies a little firmer (and it's quicker!).
5.  Once the pot is done cooking, either let it sit for 15-20 minutes to naturally release pressure, or carefully open the vent (keep your hand out of the path of the steam) for about 2 minutes. Once pressure has released completely (the pin drops) the pot is safe to open.
6.  Remove thyme sprigs (keeping leaves when possible). Stir pot to shred chicken and mix in any extra liquid. Serve warm.
