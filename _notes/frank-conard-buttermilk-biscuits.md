Originally from Dad

Note w/ the Lodge cast iron biscuit pan, Christmas 2014:

>Here it is—the best biscuit recipe in existence, passed down from generation to generation of Conards until memorialized by Lodge when the 7 drop biscuit pan was invented- since 1896. At least that’s the way family history tells it. Like my Daddy always said—“if you’re going to tell a story, make it a good one!”

>You guys enjoy the biscuits!
