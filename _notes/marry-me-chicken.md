Makes 4 servings
### Ingredients

* 3 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, or 6 chicken cutlets (about 2¼ pounds total), patted dry
- Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano 
- Red-pepper flakes, to taste  
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken stock
- ½ to ¾ cup heavy cream
- ½ cup (1½ ounces) grated Parmesan
- ⅓ cup sliced sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil
- Fresh basil, for serving

### Instructions

1. If using chicken breasts, start from the thickest end and slice each chicken breast in half horizontally so you end up with a total of 6 cutlets (see Tip). Season both sides of the chicken cutlets well with salt and pepper
2. Scatter the flour on a large plate and coat the cutlets, shaking off the excess. Transfer the cutlets to a sheet pan or large plate in a single layer.
3. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high. Once hot, reduce the heat to medium and add the butter. As soon as it melts, add the cutlets and cook until golden on one side, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook the other side until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Do this in batches, if needed, adding more oil, if needed. Transfer the cutlets to a plate or sheet pan.
4. Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, stirring until the color deepens, about 2 minutes. Add the oregano and red-pepper flakes, to taste.
5. Increase the heat to medium, add the stock and bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pan, until the liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
6. Add ½ cup of the cream and warm through, stirring, until it thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Watch the cream closely, reducing the heat if necessary, to maintain a gentle simmer. Stir in the Parmesan and the sun-dried tomatoes. Add more cream, if you like, and season the sauce.
7. Place the chicken back in the pan to warm through, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and scatter basil on top.

## Notes
- To make it easier to slice into cutlets, place the chicken breasts in the freezer for 20 minutes.
- Really good with roasted red peppers
