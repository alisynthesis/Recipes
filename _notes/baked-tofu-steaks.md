Makes 2 servings

Prep 30 minutes

Cook 1 hour, 15 minutes

Total 1 hour, 45 minutes

### Ingredients

*   One 14 oz block extra firm tofu, drained
*   1 tiny garlic clove, peeled

#### For the marinade

*   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
*   3 tablespoons light soy sauce
*   A pinch of dried Italian seasoning or poultry seasoning, optional
*   Cracked black pepper

### Instructions

1.  Cut the tofu vertically in half. Then cut each half widthwise into two pieces. You will have 4 tofu pieces. Using a kitchen towel, pat the tofu pieces to absorb as much moisture as you can.
2.  Make 2 small slits on top of each tofu piece. Thinly slice the garlic clove into 8 slices. Insert one slice of garlic into each slit on the tofu. Skip this step if you donâ€™t like garlic.
3.  Whisk together all marinade ingredients and pour into a dish. Place the tofu slices in the dish with the marinade. Carefully flip the tofu pieces so they are covered all over by the marinade. Let the tofu marinade for about 15 minutes.
4.  Pre heat oven to 350f
5.  Remove the tofu pieces from the marinade and place on a non-stick baking dish. Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, flipping the tofu pieces every 20 minutes. Cooking times will vary depending on your oven and thickness of tofu slices.
6.  Tofu is done when it is firm and browned all over.
