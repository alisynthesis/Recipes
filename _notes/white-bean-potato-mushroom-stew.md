### Ingredients
*   3 Tbsp butter
-   1 medium onion, diced (1 medium onion yields ~2 cups)
-   1 lb mushrooms, sliced (1 lb yields ~7 cups // we like a mixture of shiitake and cremini)
-   3/4 tsp dried thyme
-   3/4 tsp dried rosemary
-   3/4 tsp sea salt and pepper
-   4 cloves garlic, minced
-   2 Tbsp cornstarch (or flour)
-   2 tsp tamari or soy sauce (ensure gluten-free as needed)
-   1 Tbsp Dijon mustard (go heavy on this)
-   3 cups vegetable broth
-   1 lb baby potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (1 lb yields ~3 cups)
-   2 (15 oz.) cans white beans, drained and rinsed (we like cannellini)
-   2 cups whole milk

### Instructions

* Add the vegan butter to a large pot or Dutch oven and heat over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the onion and sauté for a few minutes. Next add mushrooms, thyme, rosemary, sea salt, and pepper. Cook for 7-10 minutes or until the mushrooms have released most of their moisture and begin to brown. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. 
- Next add the cornstarch, tamari, and mustard. Stir to coat the vegetables. Add the vegetable broth and potatoes and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally.
- Stir in the beans and dairy-free milk and simmer for another 10-15 minutes until the stew has thickened and the vegetables are tender. Adjust for seasoning and thickness as needed, adding more tamari or salt for saltiness, mustard for acidity, or dairy-free milk to thin it slightly.
-   Serve warm and optionally garnish with parsley and a sprinkle of freshly cracked black pepper.
-   Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. It will thicken as it sits. To thin, add more broth, dairy-free milk, or water when you reheat.

Serves 4
