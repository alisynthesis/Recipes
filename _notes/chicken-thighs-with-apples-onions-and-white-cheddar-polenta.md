Makes 4 servings

### Ingredients

*   8 slicesÂ smoked bacon
*   1 tablespoon EVOO
*   8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
*   Salt and pepper
*   3 tablespoons butter
*   3 liberty, braeburn or other crisp apples, thinly sliced
*   1 onion, halved and sliced
*   2 tablespoons chopped thyme
*   7 - 8 sage leaves, thinly sliced
*   Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste
*   1/2 cup chicken stock
*   1/2 cup apple cider
*   1/4 cup apple brandy, bourbon, or whatever
*   1 cup polenta
*   1 cup half and half
*   2 cups chicken stock
*   1 cup water
*   1 1/2 cups shredded sharp white cheddar, gorgonzola, etc.

### Instructions

1.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees . Arrange the bacon on a broiler pan and bake until crisp, about 10 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the EVOO, a turn of the pan, over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper; add to the skillet and cook, turning once, until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate
3.  Add the butter to the skillet to melt. Add the apples, onion, thyme and sage. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cook until the apples are crisp-tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in about 1/2 cup chicken stock, the apple cider and apple brandy. Add the chicken, coat with the sauce, lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
4.  Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring the remaining 2 cups stock and the milk to a boil. Whisk in the polenta and cook, whisking constantly, until thick, 2 to 3 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Whisk in the cheese until melted. Serve on rimmed plates and top with the chicken, apples, onion and crisscrossed slices of bacon.

### Additional notes

You can also use crumbled frozen bacon....just put it on top when you put the chicken back in.
