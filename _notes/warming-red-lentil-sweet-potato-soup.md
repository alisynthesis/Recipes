### Instructions

#### INSTANT POT

*   Turn on the sauté function on your [Instant Pot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RCNHTLS/?tag=minimalistbaker-20) (to the default “Normal” — not high or low). Once hot, add water (or oil), onion, garlic, and ginger. Season with a healthy pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Sauté for 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently, or until onion is translucent and fragrant. Add a little bit more water as needed to prevent sticking.
    
*   Add sweet potato and stir. Sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently and adding a little more water as needed to prevent sticking (we added 2 Tbsp (30 ml)). Sweet potato should be slightly tender when pierced with a fork or knife.
    
*   Turn off the sauté function by pressing “Cancel.” Then add red lentils, vegetable broth, water, turmeric, cinnamon, clove (optional), cayenne, and sea salt, and stir.
    
*   Put on the Instant Pot lid and turn to seal. Pressure cook on HIGH for 5 minutes (it will take about 5-10 minutes for the Instant Pot to pressurize before cooking begins). Once the timer goes off, let the steam release naturally (~15 minutes), or carefully press the quick release if in a hurry. Turn off the Instant Pot by pressing “Cancel.”
    
*   Carefully open the lid and add coconut milk and maple syrup (optional) and purée with an [immersion blender](https://www.amazon.com/Mueller-Austria-Ultra-Stick-Multi-Purpose-Attachment/dp/B075X1KPLZ/?tag=minimalistbaker-20) until smooth (or let cool slightly before transferring to a [high-speed blender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008H4SLV6/?tag=minimalistbaker-20)). Taste test and add more maple syrup for sweetness, coconut milk for creaminess, cinnamon for warmth, cayenne for heat, and salt for overall flavor.
    
*   Option to garnish with toasted pepitas, a swirl of coconut milk, and a pinch of cinnamon and cayenne. Best when fresh. Leftovers will keep 4-5 days in the refrigerator or up to 1 month in the freezer. Reheat in a saucepan on the stovetop.
    

#### STOVETOP

*   Heat a large pot or [Dutch oven](https://www.amazon.com/Marquette-Castings-Cast-Iron-Dutch/dp/B01N7OU4JK/?tag=minimalistbaker-20) over medium heat. Once hot, add water (or oil), onion, garlic, and ginger. Season with a healthy pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Sauté for 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently, or until onion is translucent and fragrant. Add a little bit more water as needed to prevent sticking.
    
*   Add sweet potato and stir. Sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently and adding a little more water as needed to prevent sticking (we added 2 Tbsp (30 ml)). Sweet potato should be slightly tender when pierced with a fork or knife.
    
*   Add red lentils, vegetable broth, water, turmeric, cinnamon, clove (optional), cayenne, and sea salt, and stir. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat, cover, and allow to simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until sweet potatoes and red lentils are tender.
    
*   Add coconut milk and maple syrup (optional) and purée with an [immersion blender](https://www.amazon.com/Mueller-Austria-Ultra-Stick-Multi-Purpose-Attachment/dp/B075X1KPLZ/?tag=minimalistbaker-20) until smooth (or let cool slightly before transferring to a [high-speed blender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008H4SLV6/?tag=minimalistbaker-20)). Taste test and add more maple syrup for sweetness, coconut milk for creaminess, cinnamon for warmth, cayenne for heat, vegetable broth or water to thin, and salt for overall flavor.
    
*   Option to garnish with toasted pepitas, a swirl of coconut milk, and a pinch of cinnamon and cayenne. Best when fresh. Leftovers will keep 4-5 days in the refrigerator or up to 1 month in the freezer. Reheat in a saucepan on the stovetop.
