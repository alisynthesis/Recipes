The transformation of butter, sugar, and salt into toffee is culinary alchemy at its best. This version is studded with cocktail peanuts and a decadent layer of bittersweet chocolate.

Makes 3 pounds

### Ingredients

*   4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter, cut into pieces
*   2 cups sugar
*   1/4 teaspoon salt
*   4 cups whole cocktail peanuts plus 1 cup chopped (1 pound 10 ounces)
*   7 to 8 ounces 70%-cacao bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
*   Equipment: a 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking pan; a candy thermometer; a metal offset spatula

### Instructions

1.  Butter baking pan and put on a heatproof surface.
2.  Bring butter, sugar, and salt to a boil in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat, whisking until smooth, then boil, stirring occasionally, until mixture is deep golden and registers 300Â°F (hard-crack stage) on thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes.
3.  Immediately stir in whole peanuts, then carefully pour hot toffee into center of baking pan. Spread with spatula, smoothing top, and let stand 1 minute, then immediately sprinkle chocolate on top. Let stand until chocolate is melted, 4 to 5 minutes, then spread over toffee with cleaned spatula. Sprinkle evenly with chopped peanuts, then freeze until chocolate is firm, about 30 minutes. Break into pieces.

### Additional notes

Halving this makes a large Tupperware full of candy.
