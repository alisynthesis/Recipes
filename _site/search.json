      "url"      : "/notes/african-chicken-peanut-stew",
      "content"  : "Originally from Simply RecipesLike peanut butter? Chicken? Then this African chicken peanut stew by Hank is for you. Perfect for chilly weather. ~Elise Chicken, sweet potatoes and peanuts are one of those magical flavor combinations that make me feel all warm and happy, especially because I never would have thought to do this 20 years ago, when I met some fellow University of Wisconsin students from Ghana who made this stew at their apartment. Chicken groundnut stew is, in various forms, common all over West Africa, and this is my version, inspired by my colleagues at UW.The best way to make this stew is with two whole stewing hens—older chickens available at Asian and Latin markets. You start by simmering the birds to make stock, which then becomes the base of the stew, and then you use the meat from the hens. This is a bit labor-intensive for most, so I normally use pre-cut chicken parts: legs, wings and especially thighs. This stew is just made for chicken thighs. What is a little unusual about how you makMakes 6-8 servingsPrep 15 minutesCook 1 hour, 45 minutesIngredients  2-3 pounds chicken legs, thighs and/or wings  3 Tbsp vegetable oil  1 large yellow or white onion, sliced  A 3-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced  6-8 garlic cloves, chopped roughly  2-3 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks  1 15-ounce can of crushed tomatoes  1 quart chicken stock  1 cup peanut butter  1 cup roasted peanuts  1 Tbsp ground coriander  1 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste  Salt and black pepper  1/4 to 1/2 cup of chopped cilantroInstructions  Heat the vegetable oil in a large soup pot set over medium-high heat. Salt the chicken pieces well, pat them dry and brown them in the oil. Don't crowd the pot, so do this in batches. Set the chicken pieces aside as they brown.  Sauté the onions in the oil for 3-4 minutes, stirring often and scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Add the ginger and garlic and sauté another 1-2 minutes, then add the sweet potatoes and stir well to combine.  Add the chicken, chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, peanut butter, peanuts, coriander and cayenne and stir well to combine. Bring to a simmer and taste for salt, adding more if needed. Cover the pot and simmer gently for 90 minutes (check after an hour), or until the chicken meat easily falls off the bone and the sweet potatoes are tender.  Remove the chicken pieces and set them in a bowl to cool, until cool enough to touch. Remove and discard the skin if you want, or chop it and put it back into the pot. Shred the meat off the bones and put the meat back in the pot.  Adjust the seasonings for salt and cayenne, then add as much black pepper as you think you can stand—the stew should be peppery. Stir in the cilantro and serve by itself, or with simple steamed rice.Additional notesUse chicken legs, thighs or wings for this recipe. They have more flavor and will hold up better with the flavors of the stew than breast meat.Other things to add: kale, pineapplesTags: #Soup"

While it heats, dice onion, mince garlic, and chop veggies. Rinse and drain rice.  When pot says \"HOT,\" add oil to pot and saute onions for 3 minutes. Then press \"cancel\" to turn the saute setting off.  Mix veggies, garlic, rice, and broth into the pot. Place chicken on top, salt and pepper, then cover with cream of chicken soup (homemade is preferable) and Worchestershire sauce. Place 8-10 small sprigs of thyme on top. NOTE: chicken breasts also work well, just make sure to cut them in half so they're not too thick.  Seal the Instant Pot, close the vent, and press \"manual.\" Use the \"pressure\" button to toggle to high pressure, then set the time for 31 minutes. After 10 seconds the pot should register that it has begun the pressurizing process. UPDATE: 26 minutes works better to keep veggies a little firmer (and it's quicker!).  Once the pot is done cooking, either let it sit for 15-20 minutes to naturally release pressure, or carefully open the vent (keep your hand out of the path of the steam) for about 2 minutes. Once pressure has released completely (the pin drops) the pot is safe to open.  Remove thyme sprigs (keeping leaves when possible). Stir pot to shred chicken and mix in any extra liquid. Serve warm.Tags: #InstantPot #OneDish"

      "content"  : "Originally from www.jamieoliver.comIngredients  1.5 kg higher-welfare chicken  sea salt  freshly ground black pepper  olive oil  ½ stick cinnamon  1 good handful fresh sage, leaves picked  zest of 2 lemons  10 cloves garlic, skin left on  2.5 cups milkInstructions  Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5, and find a snug-fitting pot for the chicken.  Season it generously all over, and fry it in a little olive oil, turning the chicken to get an even colour all over, until golden.  Remove from the heat, put the chicken on a plate, and throw away the oil left in the pot. This will leave you with tasty sticky goodness at the bottom of the pan which will give you a lovely caramel flavour later on.  Put your chicken back in the pot with the rest of the ingredients, and cook in the preheated oven for 1½ hours. Baste with the cooking juice when you remember. The lemon zest will sort of split the milk, making a sauce which is absolutely fantastic.  To serve, pull the meat off the bones and divide it onto your plates. Spoon over plenty of juice and the little curds.  Serve with wilted spinach or greens and some mashed potato.Tags: #standout #MainDish"

Place a 9-inch round tart pan (ideally with a removable bottom) on a rimmed baking sheet. Finely grind cookies with sugar and salt in a food processor. Add melted butter and process until clumpy. (See note up top about needing more with other types of cookies.) Press crumb mixture firmly into bottom and up sides of pan. Bake until crust is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. If any parts of the crumb walls have fallen or slumped, you can press them gently back into place with a spoon. Let cool completely. I have no patience for long cooling processes and put it in the freezer for 15 minutes.  Make the filling: In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, butter, sugar, peanut butter, salt and vanilla together until fluffy with an electric mixer or with good elbow grease, a big whisk. Scrape the mixture into the tart shell and smooth the surface with a spatula. Chill this while you prepare the topping — again, I just slide it into the freezer for 10 minutes. A cold surface helps the chocolate set faster.  Make the topping: Heat chocolate, pinch of salt and cream together in a microwave or saucepan until the chips are mostly melted. Stir until smooth. Let sit for 5 minutes to cool slightly then pour over peanut butter filling and gently spread smooth. Sprinkle with flaky salt, if desired. Chill the tart until firm. As you can guess, I do this in the freezer for 15 minutes or so because I like to have my treats as soon as possible. An hour in the fridge would also do the trick.Additional notesI swapped the suggested graham crust for a shortbread one closer to the original cookie (but let’s be honest, so much better because: butter). One of the pesky things about crumb crusts is that I find that depending on the crumbs used and how finely ground they are, you might need more or less butter. Here, using shortbread loaded with butter, I only needed 3T melted butter to get the crumbs clumpy enough to form a crust. With the same amount of graham crumbs, I usually need 4T. I like to parbake crumb crusts because I think they set much better this way. The sugar helps “glue” the crust together too, but I still use as little as possible. I found that the recipe better filled out a 9-inch/1-inch tall tart pan than a standard pie dish. Should you not have a tart pan, you could still make this in a standard (not deep-dish) pie dish, but it might help to only press the 2/3 the way up the sides. Or, if you’d really like to fill out a standard pie pan, you could double the filling and chocolate This should also work in a 8-inch square baking pan. Put a long piece of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan, letting the parchment extend up the two short sides of the pan and overhang slightly on both ends; this sling will hopefully make the bars easier to remove.Tags: #dessert"

      "content"  : "Originally from cooking.nytimes.com  This Sri Lankan curry goes together fairly quickly despite the long list of ingredients. I used skinless, boneless thigh meat, because it always stays moist and can absorb a lot of flavor from a short marinade in ginger, garlic and spices. To intensify the taste, the cashews and coconut are used two ways. First, a handful of each is ground to a powder and added to the sauce. Then after simmering for 30 minutes or so, the curry is finished with a generous cup of thick coconut milk and garnished with toasted cashews.I also added, because I like it and thought it would harmonize nicely, a totally nontropical vegetable, parsnip — optional, but delicious.Featured in: Sri Lankan Dishes Answer Call For Inspiration.Makes 4 to 6 servingsCook 1 hourIngredients  2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut in 3-inch chunks  Salt and pepper  1 tablespoon grated ginger  2 teaspoons grated garlic  ¼ teaspoon cloves  ¼ teaspoon fennel seeds  ¼ teaspoon cardamom seeds  ¼ teaspoon allspice berries  ¼ teaspoon cumin seeds  ¼ teaspoon coriander seeds  ¼ teaspoon turmeric  ¼ teaspoon cayenne, or more to taste  3 tablespoons lemon juice  ¾ cup raw cashews  ¼ cup shredded dried unsweetened coconut  1 pound small parsnips, peeled and cut in 2-inch batons, optional  2 tablespoons ghee, coconut oil or vegetable oil  1 ½ cups finely diced onion  1 tablespoon tomato paste  1 2-inch piece cinnamon stick  3 cups chicken broth or water  1 cup thick coconut milk  A few sprigs mint and cilantro for garnish, optionalInstructions  Season chicken generously with salt and pepper and put it in a mixing bowl. Add ginger and garlic and massage into meat. In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast cloves, fennel, cardamom, allspice, cumin and coriander until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Grind the toasted spices to a fine powder in an electric spice mill and add to chicken. Add turmeric, cayenne and lemon juice and mix well. Let marinate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes, or refrigerate up to 1 hour.  Heat oven to 375 degrees. Put cashews on a baking sheet and roast until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool. Spread the shredded coconut on the baking sheet and toast until lightly browned, about 5 minutes, then let cool. Grind the coconut with 1/4 cup cashews in a spice mill or small food processor to make a rough powder. Reserve 1/2 cup roasted cashews for garnish.  Bring a small saucepan of lightly salted water to a simmer, then add parsnips and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool.  In a wide heavy-bottomed pot, heat ghee over medium-high heat. Add cooked parsnips, if using, and sauté until lightly browned. Remove and reserve. Add chicken pieces to the pot, stirring occasionally until lightly browned, about 5 minutes, then remove and set aside. Add onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes more. Add tomato paste and let it sizzle with onions for a minute or two. Add broth and bring to a brisk simmer, stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping up any caramelized bits from the pot. Add cinnamon stick, chicken and the ground coconut and cashew mixture. Adjust heat to a gentle simmer, cover and cook for about 30 minutes, until chicken is tender. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning if necessary.  To finish the dish, stir in coconut milk and add reserved parsnips. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until parsnips are heated through and the sauce has thickened slightly. Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with reserved cashews.

      "content"  : "This is a ridiculously easy, unbelievably delicious recipe for chocolate pie.Originally from freethoughtblogs.comIngredients  1 single pie crust (this is an open-faced pie). More on pie crust in a tic.  1 stick butter  1 cup sugar  2 eggs  3 Tbsp. evaporated milk  2 squares/ ounces baking chocolate (unsweetened)  Whipped cream (optional in theory, mandatory in my opinion)  If you want:  1/8 tsp. ground cardamom  1/8 tsp. ground nutmeg  1/4 tsp. ground white pepperInstructions  Bake the unfilled pie shell for 5-10 minutes at 450 degrees, until it’s starting to firm up a little but isn’t cooked through  Melt butter and chocolate in a saucepan  Add the other ingredients (minus the whipped cream) and mix; you can do this in the saucepan. (I add the eggs last, so the melted butter and chocolate have a chance to cool and the eggs don’t scramble.)  Pour the filling into the pie shell.  Bake for 30-40 minutes at 325 degrees, until the filling is set. (I usually test it at 30 minutes, but it usually still needs another 5-10 minutes. When it’s no longer jiggling in the middle, it’s done.)Additional notesA quick note on the baking chocolate: For the sweet love of Loki and all the gods in Valhalla, use Scharffen Berger’s if you possibly can, or some other seriously good baking chocolate. I made this pie for years using just regular baking chocolate from the supermarket, and it was perfectly yummy… but once I started using Scharffen Berger’s, it amped up from delicious to transcendent. I frankly don’t much care for Scharffen Berger’s eating chocolate, I think the mouth- feel is insufficiently creamy… but for cooking, their baking chocolate is beyond compare."
