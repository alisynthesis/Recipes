This is a private/not-private recipe site for Alison Wilder. It's a fork of [[Simply Jekyll::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll]]!

I use Obsidian to keep track of most everything, including my recipes. So I figured a way to deploy them to the internet so I could access them from every device would be good!
